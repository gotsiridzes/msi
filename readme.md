# Data Center Tier levels

Data center tier levels, often referred to as the Uptime Institute's Tier Classification System, are a standardized method for categorizing data centers based on their infrastructure's reliability, redundancy, and availability. The Tier Classification System was developed by the Uptime Institute, a global advisory organization focused on improving the performance, efficiency, and reliability of data centers. The system consists of four tiers, each representing a progressively higher level of resilience and uptime. Here's an overview of each tier:
* Tier I: Basic Capacity
Tier I data centers have basic infrastructure components and minimal redundancy.
They are typically used for small businesses or organizations with non-critical IT operations.
Tier I data centers provide 99.671% uptime on an annual basis, translating to approximately 28.8 hours of downtime per year.
* Tier II: Redundant Capacity Components
Tier II data centers have redundant infrastructure components to support maintenance activities and mitigate the risk of downtime.
They offer higher reliability and availability compared to Tier I facilities.
Tier II data centers provide 99.741% uptime on an annual basis, equivalent to approximately 22 hours of downtime per year.
* Tier III: Concurrently Maintainable
Tier III data centers are designed with multiple active power and cooling distribution paths, allowing for maintenance without disrupting operations.
They offer a high level of fault tolerance and availability, with no single points of failure.
Tier III data centers provide 99.982% uptime on an annual basis, resulting in approximately 1.6 hours of downtime per year.
* Tier IV: Fault Tolerant
Tier IV data centers are the most robust and fault-tolerant, designed to withstand equipment failures, power outages, and other disruptions without impacting operations.
They have redundant components and systems, including backup power and cooling, to ensure continuous operation.
Tier IV data centers provide 99.995% uptime on an annual basis, equating to approximately 26.3 minutes of downtime per year.

It's important to note that achieving a specific tier level requires compliance with strict design and operational criteria outlined by the Uptime Institute. Data center operators may choose to certify their facilities according to the Tier Classification System to demonstrate their commitment to uptime and reliability to clients and stakeholders. Additionally, some organizations may opt for a customized approach that combines elements from multiple tiers to meet their specific requirements for resilience and availability.

# Data center cooling systems

Data center cooling is a critical aspect of maintaining optimal operating conditions for servers and other hardware. Several types of cooling systems are commonly used in data centers to manage temperature and humidity levels efficiently. Here are some of the most common data center cooling types:
* Precision Air Conditioning (PAC): Precision air conditioning systems are specifically designed for data centers and offer greater control over temperature and humidity levels. These units use advanced technology to maintain precise environmental conditions within the data center space.
* Computer Room Air Conditioning (CRAC): CRAC units are specialized air conditioners designed to cool data center spaces. They often include features such as humidification and dehumidification to maintain optimal environmental conditions for IT equipment.
* Chilled Water Systems: Chilled water systems use water as a cooling medium to remove heat from data center equipment. These systems circulate chilled water through pipes to absorb heat from server racks and other hardware components, then return the warmed water to a chiller unit for cooling.
* Direct Expansion (DX) Cooling: DX cooling systems use refrigerant to cool the air directly. These systems can be more energy-efficient than traditional air conditioning systems because they eliminate the need for air handlers and associated ductwork.
* Evaporative Cooling: Evaporative cooling systems use the natural process of water evaporation to cool the air. These systems are often used in conjunction with other cooling methods to increase efficiency, especially in regions with low humidity levels.
* Containment Systems: Containment systems, such as hot aisle containment and cold aisle containment, help to isolate hot and cold air within the data center environment. By containing hot air exhaust from servers, these systems improve cooling efficiency and prevent hot and cold air from mixing.
* Liquid Cooling: Liquid cooling involves directly cooling server components using liquid coolant, such as water or specialized cooling fluids. This method is highly efficient at removing heat from IT equipment but requires careful design and implementation to prevent leaks and corrosion.
* Each of these cooling types has its advantages and is chosen based on factors such as data center size, IT equipment density, energy efficiency goals, and environmental conditions. Many data centers use a combination of these cooling methods to achieve optimal cooling performance while minimizing energy consumption and operational costs.

* A Storage Area Network (SAN) switch is a specialized networking device designed to connect storage devices such as disk arrays, tape libraries, and servers to create a high-speed, dedicated storage network. SAN switches play a crucial role in facilitating data storage, retrieval, and management within enterprise environments. Here's an overview of SAN switches:
    * Purpose:
        * SAN switches are used to establish a dedicated and high-performance storage network separate from the main data network.
        * They enable multiple storage devices and servers to communicate and access shared storage resources efficiently.
        * SAN switches provide connectivity for Fibre Channel (FC), Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE), or iSCSI protocols, which are commonly used in SAN environments.

    * Architecture:
        * SAN switches are typically designed as high-speed, low-latency devices to handle the heavy data traffic associated with storage operations.
        * They feature multiple ports (8 ports, 16 ports, 32 ports, etc.) to connect storage devices, servers, and other SAN components.

# Storage

Storage technology offers several advantages that are crucial for modern computing environments:

* Data Persistence: Storage devices provide persistent storage, allowing data to be stored even when the power is turned off. This is essential for retaining important information and ensuring data durability.
* Data Capacity: Modern storage solutions offer large capacities, ranging from gigabytes to terabytes and even petabytes. This allows organizations to store vast amounts of data, including documents, multimedia files, databases, and more.
* Data Accessibility: Storage systems provide quick and convenient access to data when needed. Whether it's accessing files locally on a computer's hard drive or retrieving data from a network-attached storage (NAS) device or a cloud storage service, data accessibility is crucial for efficient operations.
* Data Redundancy and Backup: Storage technologies such as RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) offer data redundancy by creating mirrored or parity copies of data across multiple disks. This provides fault tolerance and protects against data loss in case of disk failures. Additionally, backup solutions ensure that data can be recovered from backups in case of accidental deletion, corruption, or disasters.
* Data Security: Storage solutions often incorporate features for data security, including encryption, access controls, and data integrity checks. These measures help protect sensitive data from unauthorized access, tampering, or loss.
* Scalability: Storage systems are designed to be scalable, allowing organizations to expand storage capacity as their data requirements grow. This scalability can be achieved through the addition of more storage drives, expansion units, or by leveraging cloud storage services that offer virtually unlimited scalability.
* Performance Optimization: Advanced storage technologies such as SSDs (Solid-State Drives) and NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express) offer high-speed data access and low latency, improving overall system performance and responsiveness.
* Cost Efficiency: Storage solutions come in a range of options with varying costs per gigabyte or terabyte of storage. Organizations can choose cost-effective storage solutions that meet their performance, capacity, and budgetary requirements.

* File storage, also known as file-level storage or file-based storage, is a hierarchical storage system for organizing and storing data. Data is kept in files, then arranged into folders and structured into a hierarchy of directories and subdirectories.
* Block storage is a technology used to store data in blocks. The blocks are then kept separately, each with its own unique identity. Developers use block storage for computer settings requiring rapid, efficient, and dependable data transport.
* Object storage is an architecture designed to handle massive volumes of unstructured data. This data does not fit into, or cannot be structured into, a standard relational database with rows and columns. Examples include email, movies, images, web pages, audio files, sensor data, and media and online content (textual or non-textual).

## Storage Types

What is storage? Why we need storage?
Storage is the collection of methods and technologies that can capture and hold digital information on media. Storage is normally described as the data storage devices that are connected to the computer through input or output operations that includes flash devices, hard disks, SAN, NAS, old tape systems and other different types of medium.

1. DAS (Directly Attached Storage)
This is as simple as it sounds DAS (Directly Attached Storage) device. A simple example of DAS is an external hard drive connected through a Universal Serial Bus (USB) cable. When we discuss about storage, we mean multiple drives, array of disks acting together in some way. The DAS concept is the same whether it’s one or 24 drives. In the same way it is the same concept regardless if we use a different cable. Basically, USB is much slow for large DAS units. DAS is well suited for a small-to-medium sized business where enough amounts of storage can be configured at a low startup cost. The DAS enclosure can be a separate cabinet that contains the additional disk drives.  An internal PCI-based RAID controller is typically configured in the server to connect to the storage.

* Advantages of DAS
    * It is simpler to setup and configure over NAS / SAN
    * It is very cost effective than NAS / SAN in terms of raw storage medium
    * It does not use IP addresses. Network is not necessary, Faster, more preformat and better latency over SAN / NAS
    * Easier to deal with overall considering all things
* Disadvantages of DAS
    * Dedicated resources are needed for a single computer
    * No economies of scale in sharing the storage
    * We cannot manage the DAS via a network
    * DAS needs a special hardware connection
 
2. NAS (Network Attached Storage)
Every computer that is irrespective of number of disks and the size of storage space available, can be considered a NAS if it acts as a file server on the network. Another way, a network attached storage (NAS) device is just a computer that shares files over the network. Theoretically it is almost identical to the external USB hard drive, except instead of a USB cable connection, a NAS will be using an Ethernet connection or some networking cable like LAN. NAS devices have a shareable resource. Multiple users and computers can use that resource. The disk arrays in both NAS and DAS are similar in function and operation, meaning you can create similar RAIDS and partition styles on both. NAS is perfect for SMBs and organizations that need a minimal-maintenance, reliable and flexible storage system that can quickly scale up as needed to accommodate new users or growing data.
* Advantages of NAS
    * It is the economical way to provide large storage to many persons or computers
    * It is several times easier to setup and configure versus SAN
    * It is easier way to provide RAID redundancy to mass amount of users
    * It allows users permissions, folder privileges, restricted access to documents, etc
    * It has higher utilization of storage resources
* Disadvantages of NAS
    * It requires IP Address and takes up network space
    * It has slower latency and potentially maximum data-transfer issues
    * It performance can be affected by network status
 
3. SAN (Storage Area Network)
SAN stands for Storage Area Network. With SAN we typically see the solutions that are used with medium-to-large size businesses, primarily due to the larger initial investment. SANs require a setup consisting of disk controllers, SAN switches, host bus adapters and fiber cables. The main benefit to a SAN-based storage solution is the ability to share the storage arrays to multiple servers.  This allows you to configure the storage capacity as needed, usually by a dedicated SAN administrator.  Higher levels of performance throughput are typical in a SAN environment and data is highly available through redundant disk controllers and drives. SAN is typically used in data centers, enterprises or virtual computing environments. It offers the speed of DAS with the sharing, flexibility and reliability of NAS. SAN storage is a very sophisticated option that’s meant to support complex, mission-critical applications.
* Advantages of SAN
    * It has economies of scale similar to that of NAS
    * It has higher hardware utilization, similar to that of NAS
    * It has speed similar or comparable to DAS
    * It allows virtual environments, cloud computing, etc.
* Disadvantages of SAN
    * Its performance is affected by other SAN users
    * Its performance is limited by network if configured incorrectly
    * Better performance will still be found using DAS hardware
    * It requires multiple static IP Addresses
    * It generally consumes more IP addresses than NAS devices

Traditional Storage; 
Software defined storage;
Hybrid Storage; 
All flash storage; 
Cloud Storage

* Tier ტიპის მონაცემთა საცავები 

* What is Tier 0 storage?
    * The top tier of the storage hierarchy traditionally started with Tier 1 storage, but the advent of solid-state and flash storage gave rise to the concept of Tier 0 storage. Tier 0 delivers greater performance than Tier 1 storage, and much of the data formerly considered Tier 1 is now stored on Tier 0.
    * Tier 0 storage is the fastest and most expensive layer in the hierarchy and is suited for mission-critical applications with little tolerance for downtime or latency. Data placed in a "zero tier" often involves scale-up transactional databases for analytics, financials, healthcare and security.
    * The storage devices that make up Tier 0 might include flash SSDs or storage class memory (SCM) devices such as Optane SSDs or memory modules. The SSDs typically use Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) or non-volatile memory express (NVMe) technologies to maximize performance. In some cases, an organization might use single-level cell (SLC) flash for its performance and reliability. Tier 0 storage might also utilize Random Access Memory (RAM) to optimize performance.

* What is Tier 1 storage?
    * Tier 1 data supports applications that are essential to an organization's ability to conduct its everyday business. Applications that rely on this data can usually tolerate higher latency and lower IOPS than Tier 0 applications. Storage costs are also more of a consideration than with Tier 0 storage, although Tier 1 still tends to use high-quality media -- such as double-parity RAID, to ensure the storage delivers the required latency and throughput, even if it's not as fast as Tier 0 storage.
    * Tier 1 storage might use SSDs, HDDs or a combination of both in a hybrid drive configuration. Hybrid storage systems cache hot data in flash for quick retrieval and write the remaining data to the HDDs. The HDDs used for Tier 1 storage tend to be the fastest and most expensive, especially if they're the sole type of storage being used at this tier.

* What is Tier 2 storage?
    * Tier 2 storage is concerned with warm data, which might include old emails, classified files, historical financial information, or a variety of other types of information. This tier might also support reporting and analytics. Tier 2 storage typically requires greater capacity for longer durations, so the emphasis shifts from performance to cost-effectiveness.
    * Tier 2 storage often serves as an organization's secondary storage, hosting Tier 0 and Tier 1 backups as part of a business continuity and disaster recovery (BC/DR) strategy. Tier 2 storage makes it possible to quickly restore key files if data on the primary storage becomes unavailable.
    * The backup data on Tier 2 storage might include enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, corporate email, back-office applications or any other application data that requires high reliability and security but doesn't need submillisecond latency.
    * Tier 2 data is preserved on lower-cost media that might include HDDs, backup appliances, tape storage or cloud storage. The HDDs are commonly based on SATA, rather than incorporating pricier RAID arrays or SAS devices. Recovery requirements often drive the type of media used for Tier 2 storage.

* What is Tier 3 storage?
    * Tier 3 storage is an archive tier that sits behind the backup tier. The data in this tier is rarely accessed or updated, if at all. The tier's storage media might include slow-spinning HDDs, recordable compact discs, tape drives or archival cloud storage services -- whatever offers the least expensive storage compared to the other tiers. Tier 3 stores fixed copies of any content deemed to have a strategic value, however slight, or content that needs to be retained to comply with applicable regulations.
    * Many organizations direct backups to Tier 2 storage for a set period of time then move the data to a Tier 3 tape library for long-term retention. The data might be retained indefinitely or set to expire by a certain date. In some cases, archival data is written to disk only once and never erased or updated.

Auto Tiering algorithm uses intelligent data analysis that continuously monitors data usage and ranks this data based on how often it is accessed. It will then use this information and make a decision on where your data should be.
how this data is being used, and how much of each tier storage should be assigned based on this information. Then at the scheduled time, the most accessed blocks that have been marked as “hot” data will be migrated into the highest performing tier, and the least accessed or “cold” data will be migrated into the lowest cost – highest capacity drive tier for the most efficient data tiering.

## Tape
The ideal situation for a tape library depends on the specific needs and requirements of an organization. However, there are several common scenarios where a tape library can be particularly beneficial:
* Long-term Data Archiving: Tape libraries are well-suited for long-term data archiving due to their low cost per terabyte and high reliability for storing data that is not frequently accessed.
* Data Backup: Tape libraries are often used for data backup purposes, especially in environments where large volumes of data need to be backed up regularly. They offer high capacity and can handle sequential access well.
* Compliance and Regulatory Requirements: Many industries have regulatory requirements regarding data retention and backup. Tape libraries can help organizations comply with these regulations by providing a secure and reliable storage solution.
* Disaster Recovery: Tape libraries are commonly used as part of a disaster recovery strategy, providing a reliable backup of critical data that can be accessed in the event of a disaster or data loss.
* Cost-Effective Storage: For organizations with large amounts of data to store but limited budgets, tape libraries can be a cost-effective storage solution compared to disk-based storage systems.
* Offline Storage: Tape libraries are ideal for offline storage, providing a physical medium that can be stored securely and offline to protect against cyber threats such as ransomware.
* Overall, the ideal situation for a tape library involves scenarios where long-term, reliable, cost-effective storage and backup solutions are needed, particularly for large volumes of data.

Tape libraries offer several advantages that make them a valuable storage solution in various scenarios:
* Cost-Effective Storage: Tape libraries have a lower cost per terabyte compared to disk-based storage solutions, making them ideal for organizations with large amounts of data to store cost-effectively.
* High Capacity: Tape cartridges can store a large amount of data, with modern tape formats offering capacities in the tens of terabytes or even higher.
* Reliability: Tape media is highly reliable, with a low failure rate compared to other storage mediums. This makes tape libraries suitable for long-term data storage and archival purposes.
* Longevity: Tape cartridges have a long shelf life, often lasting for several decades when stored properly. This makes them suitable for archival purposes and compliance with data retention requirements.
* Offline Storage: Tape libraries provide offline storage capabilities, allowing organizations to create air-gapped backups that are not vulnerable to cyberattacks such as ransomware.
* Scalability: Tape libraries are scalable, allowing organizations to easily expand their storage capacity by adding additional tape drives and cartridges as needed.
* Energy Efficiency: Tape libraries consume less power compared to disk-based storage systems, contributing to lower operational costs and environmental sustainability.
* Sequential Access: Tape storage is well-suited for applications that require sequential access to data, such as data backup and archival workflows.
* Data Integrity: Tape libraries use error correction techniques and verification mechanisms to ensure data integrity, reducing the risk of data corruption over time.
* Compliance: Many industries have regulatory requirements for data retention and backup. Tape libraries help organizations comply with these regulations by providing a secure and reliable storage solution.

While tape libraries offer several advantages, they also have some disadvantages that organizations should consider:
* Slow Access Speed: Compared to disk-based storage systems, tape libraries have slower access speeds, especially when it comes to random access. This can make them less suitable for applications that require rapid data retrieval.
* Limited Concurrent Access: Tape drives typically support limited concurrent access, which can be a limitation in environments where multiple users or systems need simultaneous access to data.
* Physical Storage Space: Tape libraries require physical space to house the tape drives, cartridges, and robotic mechanisms for loading and unloading tapes. This can be a concern for organizations with limited space availability.
* Media Fragility: While tape media is generally reliable, it can be more susceptible to physical damage compared to disk-based storage. Mishandling of tapes or exposure to extreme environmental conditions can lead to data loss.
* Maintenance Requirements: Tape drives and libraries require regular maintenance, including cleaning, calibration, and periodic replacement of components such as drive heads and belts. This adds to the overall cost of ownership.
* Initial Setup Complexity: Setting up and configuring a tape library system can be more complex compared to plug-and-play disk storage solutions. It may require specialized expertise and careful planning.
* Limited Compatibility: Tape formats and standards can evolve over time, leading to compatibility issues between older and newer tape drives and media. Organizations may need to manage compatibility issues when upgrading or expanding their tape library infrastructure.
* Data Retrieval Latency: Retrieving data from tape libraries can involve latency, especially for data stored on offline tapes that need to be mounted and loaded into drives before access.
* Degrading Performance with Age: As tape drives and media age, they may experience performance degradation and increased error rates, requiring proactive monitoring and maintenance.
